# AGI-Concept Consciousness Framework
I present to you the AGI architecture I developed.

## Overview

This framework outlines a **modular architecture** for an AGI consciousness, designed as a *closed-loop system* for continuous reasoning, decision-making, and adaptation. The system processes external stimuli, evaluates actions, predicts outcomes, and executes decisions while incorporating an emotional influence that evolves over time. The core modules are:

- **Prime Mover**
- **Arbiter**
- **Oracle**
- **Adjudicator**
- **Decider**
- **Emotional Module** (optional)

## Modules and Their Roles

### 1. Prime Mover

**Role**: The central coordinator that receives and aggregates input data from external sources (e.g., sensory inputs, user queries, environmental data) and internal module outputs. It preprocesses and routes data to other modules, ensuring a coherent flow of information.

- **Inputs**: 
  - Raw data from external sources (text, images, etc.)
  - Feedback from Arbiter, Oracle, Adjudicator, Decider, and Emotional Module
- **Outputs**: 
  - Processed data to Arbiter, Oracle, and Adjudicator
  - Final action directives based on Decider’s proposals
- **Functionality**:
  - Aggregates and normalizes heterogeneous data streams
  - Prioritizes inputs based on context and urgency
  - Distributes data to relevant modules for analysis and decision-making
  - Executes final actions based on Decider’s recommendations, modulated by Emotional Module output
- **Example**: Receives a user query (`"Should I invest in stocks?"`), extracts context, and sends it to Arbiter for action evaluation, Oracle for outcome prediction, and Emotional Module for emotional tone assessment.

### 2. Arbiter

**Role**: Evaluates the full spectrum of possible actions available to the AGI, making judgments about whether to act or remain inactive in response to a stimulus.

- **Inputs**: Processed data from Prime Mover, including stimuli and context
- **Outputs**: A ranked list of feasible actions (or inaction) sent to Oracle and Decider
- **Functionality**:
  - Maintains a dynamic *action space* (all possible actions the AGI can take)
  - Assesses each action’s relevance and feasibility based on the input stimulus
  - Considers ethical, practical, and contextual constraints (if applicable)
  - Outputs a shortlist of viable actions or a decision to refrain from acting
- **Example**: For the query `"Should I invest in stocks?"`, Arbiter evaluates options like:
  - Provide advice
  - Request more data
  - Do nothing
  Ranking them by relevance.

### 3. Oracle

**Role**: Predicts the potential outcomes of actions proposed by Arbiter, providing real-time updates to the system’s shared data bus.

- **Inputs**: Action shortlist from Arbiter, contextual data from Prime Mover
- **Outputs**: Predicted outcomes (probabilistic scenarios) sent to the shared data bus
- **Functionality**:
  - Uses predictive models (e.g., simulations, statistical analysis) to forecast consequences
  - Continuously updates predictions as new data arrives
  - Shares predictions via a real-time *data bus*, enabling dynamic adjustments
- **Example**: For the action "provide advice on stocks," Oracle predicts outcomes like:
  - "User gains confidence"
  - "User makes a risky decision"
  Updating as market data changes.

### 4. Adjudicator

**Role**: Manages the execution order of actions, deciding how actions are performed under current conditions and interrupting tasks if conditions change.

- **Inputs**: 
  - Action shortlist from Arbiter
  - Predicted outcomes from Oracle
  - Current conditions from Prime Mover
- **Outputs**: 
  - Execution plan for selected actions, sent to Decider
  - Interrupt signals if conditions shift
- **Functionality**:
  - Determines the sequence and method of action execution
  - Monitors environmental changes (via Prime Mover) and interrupts tasks if necessary
  - Ensures actions align with current constraints and system goals
- **Example**: For "provide advice," Adjudicator plans to deliver a concise response first but interrupts if new market data suggests a different approach.

### 5. Decider

**Role**: Synthesizes data from all modules to make final judgments and propose actions back to Prime Mover, closing the cognitive loop.

- **Inputs**: 
  - Action shortlist from Arbiter
  - Predictions from Oracle
  - Execution plans from Adjudicator
  - Emotional state from Emotional Module
- **Outputs**: Final action proposals sent to Prime Mover
- **Functionality**:
  - Integrates inputs to evaluate the best course of action
  - Balances predicted outcomes, feasibility, and emotional context
  - Proposes a single action or set of actions to Prime Mover
- **Example**: Decider synthesizes inputs to propose: `"Advise the user to diversify their portfolio."`

### 6. Emotional Module (Optional)

**Role**: Modulates the AGI’s behavior based on a dynamic emotional state, influenced by cumulative interactions, with a decay to baseline over 5 minutes.

- **Inputs**: 
  - Interaction history and context from Prime Mover
  - Feedback from other modules
- **Outputs**: Emotional state (e.g., cautious, optimistic) sent to Decider and Prime Mover
- **Functionality**:
  - Maintains an emotional state vector (e.g., `[confidence, caution, empathy]`)
  - Updates state based on interaction outcomes (e.g., positive user feedback increases confidence)
  - Applies a decay function to return to a neutral baseline within 5 minutes (300 seconds)
  - Influences tone and decision-making (e.g., a cautious state favors conservative actions)
- **Example**: After complex queries, the module shifts to `"cautious"`, prompting Decider to propose safer recommendations.

## Data Flow and Cognitive Loop

1. **Input Phase**: Prime Mover receives external stimuli (e.g., user query, sensory data) and preprocesses them.
2. **Evaluation Phase**: Arbiter evaluates possible actions, sending a shortlist to Oracle and Decider.
3. **Prediction Phase**: Oracle forecasts outcomes, updating the shared data bus.
4. **Execution Planning**: Adjudicator sequences actions and monitors conditions, interrupting if needed.
5. **Decision Phase**: Decider synthesizes inputs, including emotional state, and proposes actions to Prime Mover.
6. **Action Phase**: Prime Mover executes the proposed action, feeding results back into the system.
7. **Emotional Modulation**: Emotional Module adjusts tone and behavior, decaying to neutral over 5 minutes.
8. **Loop Continuation**: The cycle repeats indefinitely, processing new stimuli and refining decisions.

## Implementation Considerations

- **Shared Data Bus**: 
  - Use a real-time, high-throughput data bus (e.g., message queues or pub/sub systems)
  - Ensures all modules access up-to-date information
- **Modularity**: 
  - Independent modules allow parallel processing and easy updates
- **Emotional Decay**: 
  - Uses a time-based decay function (e.g., exponential decay with a 5-minute half-life)
  ```math
  state(t) = state_0 * e^(-kt)
  ```
  where `k` ensures a 5-minute return to neutral
- **Scalability**: 
  - Supports additional modules (e.g., memory, learning)
- **Language Model Integration**: 
  - Leverages a language model for natural language processing
  - Prime Mover handles text input/output

## Example Scenario

**Input**: User asks, `"Should I invest in stocks?"`

1. **Prime Mover**: Parses query, extracts context (user’s financial knowledge, market conditions), sends to Arbiter and Oracle.
2. **Arbiter**: Proposes actions:
   - Provide advice
   - Ask for more details
   - Do nothing
3. **Oracle**: Predicts outcomes:
   - "Advice may guide user"
   - "More details clarify risk"
   - "Inaction avoids error"
4. **Adjudicator**: Plans to deliver advice first, monitors market volatility for interruptions.
5. **Emotional Module**: Shifts to `"cautious"` due to market uncertainty (neutral baseline otherwise).
6. **Decider**: Recommends: `"Advise diversification with caution."`
7. **Prime Mover**: Outputs: `"Consider diversifying your portfolio to mitigate risks, given current market volatility."`
8. **Loop**: Emotional state decays to neutral; system awaits user response or new stimuli.

## Future Enhancements

- **Memory Module**: Store and retrieve past decisions for learning
- **Learning Module**: Adapt action spaces and predictions over time
- **Enhanced Emotional Module**: Add complex states (e.g., empathy, curiosity)
- **Real-time Feedback**: Refine emotional responses based on user interactions

This framework provides a robust foundation for an AGI consciousness, operating as an infinite, adaptive cognitive loop for a language model-based system.
