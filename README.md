I present to you the AGI architecture developed by me

# AGI Consciousness Framework

## Overview

This framework outlines a **modular architecture** for an AGI consciousness, designed as a *closed-loop system* for continuous reasoning, decision-making, and adaptation. The system processes external stimuli, evaluates actions, predicts outcomes, and executes decisions, incorporating an emotional influence that evolves over time. The **Decider** module, powered by a neural network, leverages interaction history to generate and select behavioral patterns, ensuring contextually appropriate actions. The core modules are:

- **Prime Mover**: Coordinates data flow and executes actions.
- **Arbiter**: Evaluates possible actions.
- **Oracle**: Predicts action outcomes.
- **Adjudicator**: Plans action execution.
- **Decider**: Uses a neural network to generate and select behavioral patterns.
- **Emotional Module**: Modulates behavior with emotional states.
- **Memory Module**: Stores interaction history and behavioral patterns.

## Modules and Their Roles

### 1. Prime Mover

**Role**: The central coordinator that aggregates input data from external sources (e.g., user queries, sensory inputs) and internal module outputs, routing data to other modules and executing final actions.

- **Inputs**:
  - Raw data (e.g., text, images)
  - Feedback from Arbiter, Oracle, Adjudicator, Decider, Emotional Module, and Memory Module
- **Outputs**:
  - Processed data to Arbiter, Oracle, Adjudicator, and Memory Module
  - Executed actions based on Decider’s proposals
- **Functionality**:
  - Aggregates and normalizes heterogeneous data streams
  - Prioritizes inputs based on context and urgency
  - Distributes data to relevant modules for analysis
  - Executes actions proposed by the Decider, modulated by emotional state
- **Example**: Receives a query (`"Should I invest in stocks?"`), extracts context (e.g., market conditions), and routes it to Arbiter, Oracle, and Memory Module.

### 2. Arbiter

**Role**: Evaluates the full spectrum of possible actions available to the AGI, deciding whether to act or remain inactive in response to stimuli.

- **Inputs**: Processed data from Prime Mover (stimuli, context)
- **Outputs**: Ranked list of feasible actions sent to Oracle, Decider, and Memory Module
- **Functionality**:
  - Maintains a dynamic *action space* (all possible AGI actions)
  - Assesses action relevance and feasibility based on stimuli
  - Considers ethical, practical, and contextual constraints
  - Outputs a shortlist of viable actions or inaction
- **Example**: For `"Should I invest in stocks?"`, proposes:
  - Provide advice (score: 0.8)
  - Request more data (score: 0.5)
  - Do nothing (score: 0.3)

### 3. Oracle

**Role**: Predicts potential outcomes of actions proposed by Arbiter, updating the shared data bus in real time.

- **Inputs**: Action shortlist from Arbiter, context from Prime Mover
- **Outputs**: Predicted outcomes (probabilistic scenarios) on the shared data bus
- **Functionality**:
  - Uses predictive models (e.g., simulations, statistical analysis) to forecast consequences
  - Updates predictions dynamically with new data
  - Shares predictions via a real-time *data bus*
- **Example**: For "provide advice," predicts:
  - "User gains confidence" (confidence: 0.7)
  - "User makes a risky decision" (confidence: 0.6)

### 4. Adjudicator

**Role**: Manages action execution order, deciding how actions are performed and interrupting tasks if conditions change.

- **Inputs**:
  - Action shortlist from Arbiter
  - Predicted outcomes from Oracle
  - Current conditions from Prime Mover
- **Outputs**:
  - Execution plan for actions, sent to Decider
  - Interrupt signals if conditions shift
- **Functionality**:
  - Sequences and methods action execution
  - Monitors environmental changes via Prime Mover
  - Ensures actions align with constraints and goals
- **Example**: Plans to deliver advice but interrupts if market volatility increases.

### 5. Decider

**Role**: Employs a neural network to generate and select behavioral patterns based on interaction history, current module inputs, and emotional context, proposing actions to Prime Mover.

- **Inputs**:
  - Action shortlist from Arbiter
  - Predicted outcomes from Oracle
  - Execution plans from Adjudicator
  - Emotional state from Emotional Module
  - Interaction history and patterns from Memory Module
- **Outputs**: Action proposals (behavioral patterns) sent to Prime Mover
- **Functionality**:
  - Uses a neural network (e.g., transformer or RNN) trained on interaction history from Memory Module
  - Generates behavioral patterns by synthesizing inputs and past experiences
  - Selects the most appropriate pattern based on context, emotional state, and predicted outcomes
  - Updates patterns in Memory Module based on action outcomes
- **Neural Network Details**:
  - **Architecture**: Transformer or RNN for sequence modeling of interactions
  - **Training Data**: Historical interactions (stimuli, actions, outcomes) from Memory Module
  - **Input Features**: Vectorized action scores, outcome probabilities, execution plans, emotional state
  - **Output**: Probability distribution over patterns (e.g., "cautious advice," "proactive query")
- **Example**: For `"Should I invest in stocks?"`, retrieves a pattern from Memory Module (`"In uncertain markets, recommend diversification"`), adjusts for high caution, and proposes: `"Advise diversification with caution."`

### 6. Emotional Module

**Role**: Modulates AGI behavior with a dynamic emotional state, influenced by interactions, decaying to neutral over 5 minutes.

- **Inputs**:
  - Interaction history and context from Prime Mover
  - Feedback from Memory Module and other modules
- **Outputs**: Emotional state (e.g., cautious, optimistic) sent to Decider and Prime Mover
- **Functionality**:
  - Maintains a state vector (e.g., `[confidence, caution, empathy]`)
  - Updates state based on interaction outcomes (e.g., positive feedback increases confidence)
  - Applies exponential decay to neutral baseline (300 seconds)
  - Influences tone and pattern selection in Decider
- **Decay Formula**:
  ```math
  state(t) = state_0 * e^(-kt), \quad k = \ln(2)/300
  ```
- **Example**: Shifts to `"cautious"` (state: `[confidence: 0.4, caution: 0.7]`) for investment queries, affecting Decider’s output.

### 7. Memory Module

**Role**: Stores and manages interaction history and behavioral patterns, providing data for the Decider’s neural network.

- **Inputs**:
  - Interaction data from Prime Mover (stimuli, context)
  - Action outcomes from Decider and Adjudicator
  - Feedback from Emotional Module
- **Outputs**: Historical data and behavioral patterns sent to Decider
- **Functionality**:
  - Stores interactions in a structured database (stimuli, actions, outcomes)
  - Identifies and reinforces recurring behavioral patterns based on success metrics
  - Provides training data for Decider’s neural network
  - Updates patterns based on action outcomes
- **Example**: Stores pattern: `"In uncertain markets, recommend diversification"` (success rate: 0.9), retrieved by Decider.

## Data Flow and Cognitive Loop

1. **Input Phase**: Prime Mover receives stimuli (e.g., user query) and preprocesses them.
2. **Evaluation Phase**: Arbiter evaluates actions, sending a shortlist to Oracle, Decider, and Memory Module.
3. **Prediction Phase**: Oracle forecasts outcomes, updating the shared data bus.
4. **Execution Planning**: Adjudicator sequences actions and monitors conditions.
5. **Pattern Generation**: Memory Module provides interaction history; Decider’s neural network generates and selects patterns.
6. **Decision Phase**: Decider proposes a pattern-based action, modulated by emotional state.
7. **Action Phase**: Prime Mover executes the action, feeding results to Memory Module.
8. **Emotional Modulation**: Emotional Module adjusts tone, decaying to neutral over 5 minutes.
9. **Loop Continuation**: The cycle repeats, refining patterns with new data.

## Implementation Considerations

- **Shared Data Bus**:
  - Real-time message queue or pub/sub system
  - Example structure:
    ```json
    {
      "prime_mover": {"input": "query", "timestamp": t},
      "decider": {"proposal": "action"}
    }
    ```
- **Decider Neural Network**:
  - Transformer or RNN, trained incrementally on Memory Module data
  - Inputs: Vectorized action scores, outcome probabilities, emotional states
  - Outputs: Probability over patterns (e.g., 0.8 for "cautious advice")
- **Memory Module**:
  - Structured storage (e.g., in-memory database, vector store)
  - Pattern reinforcement via frequency and success metrics
- **Emotional Decay**:
  - Exponential decay with 300-second half-life
- **Scalability**: Supports additional modules (e.g., ethics, learning).
- **Language Model Integration**: Built on a language model for text processing.

## Example Scenario

**Input**: User asks, `"Should I invest in stocks?"`

1. **Prime Mover**: Parses query, extracts context (market volatility, user profile), routes to Arbiter, Oracle, and Memory Module.
2. **Arbiter**: Proposes actions:
   - Provide advice (score: 0.8)
   - Request more data (score: 0.5)
   - Do nothing (score: 0.3)
3. **Oracle**: Predicts outcomes:
   - "Advice guides user" (confidence: 0.7)
   - "More data clarifies risk" (confidence: 0.6)
4. **Adjudicator**: Plans to deliver advice, monitors market changes.
5. **Memory Module**: Retrieves pattern: `"In uncertain markets, recommend diversification"` (success rate: 0.9).
6. **Emotional Module**: Shifts to `"cautious"` (state: `[confidence: 0.4, caution: 0.7]`).
7. **Decider**: Neural network processes inputs, selects pattern, and proposes: `"Advise diversification with caution."`
8. **Prime Mover**: Outputs: `"Consider diversifying your portfolio to mitigate risks."`
9. **Loop**: Memory Module stores outcome; emotional state decays; system awaits new input.

## Future Enhancements

- **Advanced Neural Network**: Implement transformer with attention for complex pattern generation.
- **Memory Optimization**: Use vector search (e.g., FAISS) for efficient pattern retrieval.
- **Emotional Complexity**: Add states like empathy or curiosity.
- **Feedback Loop**: Apply reinforcement learning to refine patterns based on user feedback.

This framework provides a robust, neural network-driven AGI consciousness for continuous, adaptive decision-making in a language model-based system.
